***Communication with a Client***

1. Choose communication channel wisely. Email or Project management tool.
2. Use visual assets as much as possible. Screenshots, gifs or videos. In a meeting a live-demo should be the go-to. 
3. Use related frames or references. Ask clients: What tools, apps and techs do they use? Use simple analogies.
4. Be empathetic, patient and constant. Clients do pay money for your services. They deserve the better version of yourself, dont you think?
5. Involve them into decision making, offer them choices. And 6. Know where to draw the line.
